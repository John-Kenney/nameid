ChangeLog for NameID Identity Provider
======================================

Version 0.3a (trunk):
  * Added 'version' field to sign-in form that can be used in the future
    to provide for backward compatibility.
  * Use JSON-RPC over HTTP directly rather than the namecoind binary.
  * Separate off the authentication logic so it can be used by separate
    projects.  See README.libauth.

Version 0.2a (2013-07-12):
  * Update login form to work with the Mozilla add-on.
  * Page layout based on Twitter's bootstrap.
  * Add more content and distribute it across multiple pages.

  * First released alpha version.
  * Provider basically working.
  * Not yet any layout or graphics.
